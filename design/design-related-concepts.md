## Whitelist vs Blacklist

White lists and black lists are two ways of filtering data. If you have a white list then you will filter in only data on the white list; if you have a black list you will filter out only data on that list.

For example, consider automatically rejecting incoming phone calls. You could have a black list of marketing companies, so everyone but them would be able to call you. Or you could have white list containing your friends' numbers, so only they would be able to call you.

TL;DR:

* Whitelist - only these things.
* Blacklist - everything but these things.
