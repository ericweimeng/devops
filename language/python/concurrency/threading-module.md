## Creating Threads

This lesson demonstrates how threads can be created in Python.

#### Creating Threads

We can create threads in Python using the `Thread` class. The constructor for the thread class appears below:

**Thread constructor**

```text
Thread(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs={}, *, daemon=None)
```

The `group` argument is reserved for future extensions. `target` is the code that the thread being created will execute. It can be any callable object. A callable object can be a function or an object of a class that has the `__call__` method. Next, we can pass the arguments to the target either as a tuple `args` or as a dictionary of key value pairs using `kwargs`. Finally, the constructor takes a boolean specifying if the thread being created should be treated as a daemon thread.

The below snippet creates a thread using the `Thread` class's constructor:

**Creating thread**

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread
 
 
def thread_task(a, b, c, key1, key2):
    print("{0} received the arguments: {1} {2} {3} {4} {5}".format(current_thread().getName(), a, b, c, key1, key2))
 
 
myThread = Thread(group=None,  # reserved
                  target=thread_task,  # callable object
                  name="demoThread",  # name of thread
                  args=(1, 2, 3),  # arguments passed to the target
                  kwargs={'key1': 777,
                          'key2': 111},  # dictionary of keyword arguments
                  daemon=None  # set true to make the thread a daemon
                  )
 
myThread.start()  # start the thread
 
myThread.join()  # wait for the thread to complete
```

Once the thread object is created, we must start it by invoking the `start()` method. Once started, the thread will execute the target.

**Main Thread**

The astute reader would realize that there has to be another thread that is actually executing the code we wrote to create a new thread. This ab initio thread is called the **main thread**. Under normal conditions, the main thread is the thread from which the Python interpreter was started. The below image captures the above script in debug mode. Notice the debugger dropdown displays two threads:

* Main Thread
* demoThread

## Subclassing Thread

This lesson demonstrates how we can subclass the Thread class to create threads.

#### Subclassing Thread

Another way to create threads is to subclass the `Thread` class. As mentioned earlier, the `threading` module is inspired from Java and Java offers a similar way of creating threads by subclassing. Consider the snippet below:

**Creating threads by subclassing Thread class**

```python
class MyTask(Thread):
 
    def __init__(self):
        Thread.__init__(self, name="subclassThread", args=(2, 3))
 
    def run(self):
        print("{0} is executing".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
```

The important caveats to remember when subclassing the `Thread` class are:

* We can only override the `run()` method and the constructor of the `Thread` class.
* `Thread.__init__()` must be invoked if the subclass choses to override the constructor.
* Note that the `args` or `kwargs` don't get passed to the `run` method.

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread


class MyTask(Thread):

    def __init__(self):
        # The two args will not get passed to the overridden
        # run method.
        Thread.__init__(self, name="subclassThread", args=(2, 3))

    def run(self):
        print("{0} is executing".format(current_thread().getName()))


myTask = MyTask()

myTask.start()  # start the thread

myTask.join()  # wait for the thread to complete

print("{0} exiting".format(current_thread().getName()))
```

## Daemon Thread

This lesson describes how daemon threads exit as soon as the main program thread exits.

#### Daemon Thread

In Greek mythology, a **daemon** was a supernatural being of a nature between gods and humans whereas in the computer science realm a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. A daemon thread in Python runs in the background. The difference between a regular thread and a daemon thread is that **a Python program will not exit until all regular/user threads terminate.** However, a program may exit if the daemon thread is still not finished.

For folks coming from Java background, this is similar to how JVM treats daemon threads. Daemon threads don't hold up a Java program from terminating.

**Marking a thread Daemon**

We can mark a thread daemon by passing in true for the `daemon` field in the `Thread` class's constructor.

**Creating a daemon thread**

```text
daemonThread = Thread(target=daemon_thread_task, daemon=True)
```

In the below snippet the main thread creates a **non-daemonic** thread and exits. However, the program continues to run. The code widget throws an error because the execution times out.

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread
import time


def regular_thread_task():
    while True:
        print("{0} executing".format(current_thread().getName()))
        time.sleep(1)

regularThread = Thread(target=regular_thread_task, name="regularThread", daemon=False)
regularThread.start()  # start the regular thread

time.sleep(3)

print("Main thread exiting but Python program doesn't")
```

In contrast, the runnable snippet below will exit even though the **daemon** thread is still executing.

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread
import time

def daemon_thread_task():
    while True:
        print("{0} executing".format(current_thread().getName()))
        time.sleep(1)

regularThread = Thread(target=daemon_thread_task, name="daemonThread", daemon=True)
regularThread.start()  # start the daemon thread

time.sleep(3)

print("Main thread exiting and Python program too")
```

Daemon threads are shut-down abruptly. Resources such as open files and database connections may not shut-down properly and daemon threads are not a good choice for such tasks. One final caveat to remember is that if you don't specify the `daemon` parameter in the constructor then the daemonic property is inherited from the current thread.

## Lock

Python's Lock is the equivalent of a Mutex and this lesson looks at its various uses.

#### Lock

Lock is the most basic or primitive synchronization construct available in Python. It offers two methods: `acquire()` and `release()`. A Lock object can only be in two states: **locked** or **unlocked**. A Lock object can only be unlocked by a thread that locked it in the first place.

A `Lock` object is equivalent of a mutex that you read about in operating systems theory.

**Acquire**

Whenever a Lock object is created it is initialized with the unlocked state. Any thread can invoke `acquire()` on the lock object to lock it. Advanced readers should note that `acquire()` can only be invoked by a single thread at any point because the GIL ensures that only one thread is being executed by the interpreter. This is in contrast to other programming languages with more robust threading models where multiple threads could be executing on different cores and theoretically attempt to acquire a lock at exactly the same time.

If a `Lock` object is already acquired/locked and a thread attempts to `acquire()` it, the thread will be blocked till the `Lock` object is released. If the caller doesn't want to be blocked indefinitely, a floating point timeout value can be passed in to the `acquire()` method. The method returns true if the lock is successfully acquired and false if not.

**Release**

The `release()` method will change the state of the Lock object to unlocked and give a chance to other waiting threads to acquire the lock. If multiple threads are already blocked on the acquire call then only one arbitrarily chosen \(varies across implementations\) thread is allowed to acquire the Lock object and proceed.

**Example**

An example is presented below where two threads share a list and one of the threads tries to modify the list while the other attempts to read it. Using a lock object we make sure that the two threads share the list in a thread-safe manner.

```python
sharedState = [1, 2, 3]
my_lock = Lock()
 
 
def thread1_operations():
    my_lock.acquire()
    print("{0} has acquired the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
    time.sleep(3)  
    sharedState[0] = 777
 
    print("{0} about to release the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    my_lock.release()
    print("{0} released the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
 
def thread2_operations():
    print("{0} is attempting to acquire the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    my_lock.acquire()
    print("{0} has acquired the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
    print(sharedState[0])
    print("{0} about to release the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
    my_lock.release()
    print("{0} released the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # create and run the two threads
    thread1 = Thread(target=thread1_operations, name="thread1")
    thread1.start()
 
    thread2 = Thread(target=thread2_operations, name="thread2")
    thread2.start()
 
    # wait for the two threads to complete
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
```

If you examine the output from the above snippet, you'll notice that thread2 blocks on acquire method and waits for thread1 to release it before it can successfully acquire it.

**Deadlock Example**

Consider the example below, where two threads are instantiated and each tries to invoke `release()` on the lock acquired by the other thread, resulting in a deadlock.

```python
from threading import *
import time


def thread_one(lock1, lock2):
    lock1.acquire()
    time.sleep(1)
    lock2.release()


def thread_two(lock1, lock2):
    lock2.acquire()
    time.sleep(1)
    lock1.release()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    lock1 = Lock()
    lock2 = Lock()

    t1 = Thread(target=thread_one, args=(lock1, lock2))
    t2 = Thread(target=thread_one, args=(lock1, lock2))

    t1.start()
    t2.start()

    t1.join()
    t2.join()
```

## RLock

#### Non-blocking lock

This lesson explains the reentrant lock in python's threading module.

You might want to do something with a resource if it is not currently locked, but if it is locked you don't bother and do something else.

#### Introduction

```python
import threading
import time

def worker(tasks):
  for task in tasks:
    time.sleep(0.001)
    if task.lock.acquire(blocking=True):
      print(f'{threading.current_thread}, {task.name} begins to start')
    else:
      print(f'{threading.current_thread}, {task.name} is working')

class Task:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.lock = threading.Lock()

tasks = [Task(f'task-{i}') for i in range(10)]
print(tasks)
for i in range(5):
  threading.Thread(target=worker, name=f'worker-{i}', args=(tasks,)).start()
```

A reentrant lock is defined as a lock which can be reacquired by the same thread. A `RLock` object carries the notion of ownership. If a thread acquires a `RLock` object, it can chose to reacquire it as many times as possible. Consider the following snippet:

Notice that if blocking set to true, '... is working' will not be printed out meaning everyone blocks there wait for the release of the lock. If it is set to False, then if it's failed to acquire a lock, it can continue execute code after the critical section.

**Reentrant lock**

## RLock

```text
# create a reentrant lock
rlock = RLock()
 
# acquire the lock twice
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()
 
# release the lock twice
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
 
```

This lesson explains the reentrant lock in python's threading module.

In contrast to `Lock`, the reentrant lock is acquired twice in the above snippet without blocking. Note that it is imperative to release the lock as many times as it is locked, otherwise the lock remains in locked state and any other threads attempting to acquire the lock get blocked. This is shown with an example below:

#### Introduction

```python
from threading import RLock
from threading import Thread


def child_task():
    rlock.acquire()
    print("child task executing")
    rlock.release()


rlock = RLock()

rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()

rlock.release()

# UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE TO MAKE THE
# PROGRAM EXIT NORMALLY.
# rlock.release()

thread = Thread(target=child_task)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

A reentrant lock is defined as a lock which can be reacquired by the same thread. A `RLock` object carries the notion of ownership. If a thread acquires a `RLock` object, it can chose to reacquire it as many times as possible. Consider the following snippet:

If you uncomment **line 20** in the above code widget the child thread would be able to execute. We can have arbitrary nesting of acquiring and releasing of the reentrant lock. For instance, the following would work:

**Reentrant lock**

```text
rlock = RLock()
 
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()
rlock.release()
 
rlock.acquire()
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
```

```python
# create a reentrant lock
rlock = RLock()
 
# acquire the lock twice
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()
 
# release the lock twice
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
 
```

The nested acquire/release calls are tracked internally by recursion level which is incremented on every `acquire()` and decremented on every `release()` by the same thread. When the recursion level is zero, the reentrant lock is in unlocked state.

In contrast to `Lock`, the reentrant lock is acquired twice in the above snippet without blocking. Note that it is imperative to release the lock as many times as it is locked, otherwise the lock remains in locked state and any other threads attempting to acquire the lock get blocked. This is shown with an example below:

**Ownership**

```python
from threading import RLock
from threading import Thread


def child_task():
    rlock.acquire()
    print("child task executing")
    rlock.release()


rlock = RLock()

rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()

rlock.release()

# UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE TO MAKE THE
# PROGRAM EXIT NORMALLY.
# rlock.release()

thread = Thread(target=child_task)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

As explained, each reentrant lock is owned by some thread when in the locked state. Only the owner thread is allowed to exercise a `release()` on the lock. If a thread different than the owner invokes `release()` a RuntimeError is thrown as shown in the example below:

If you uncomment **line 20** in the above code widget the child thread would be able to execute. We can have arbitrary nesting of acquiring and releasing of the reentrant lock. For instance, the following would work:

**Releasing unowned reentrant lock**

```text
rlock = RLock()
 
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()
rlock.acquire()
rlock.release()
 
rlock.acquire()
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
rlock.release()
```

```python
from threading import RLock
from threading import Thread
 
 
def perform_unlock():
    rlock.release()
    print("child task executing")
    rlock.release()
 
 
rlock = RLock()
 
# reentrant lock acquired by main thread
rlock.acquire()
 
# let's attempt to unlock using a child thread
thread = Thread(target=perform_unlock)
thread.start()
thread.join()
 
```

The nested acquire/release calls are tracked internally by recursion level which is incremented on every `acquire()` and decremented on every `release()` by the same thread. When the recursion level is zero, the reentrant lock is in unlocked state.

Recognize this isn't a problem with non-reentrant locks.

**Ownership**

As explained, each reentrant lock is owned by some thread when in the locked state. Only the owner thread is allowed to exercise a `release()` on the lock. If a thread different than the owner invokes `release()` a RuntimeError is thrown as shown in the example below:

**Releasing unowned reentrant lock**

```python
from threading import RLock
from threading import Thread
 
 
def perform_unlock():
    rlock.release()
    print("child task executing")
    rlock.release()
 
 
rlock = RLock()
 
# reentrant lock acquired by main thread
rlock.acquire()
 
# let's attempt to unlock using a child thread
thread = Thread(target=perform_unlock)
thread.start()
thread.join()
 
```

Recognize this isn't a problem with non-reentrant locks.

## Condition Variables

This lesson explains the concept of condition variables in Python.

#### Condition Variables

Synchronization mechanisms need more than just mutual exclusion; a general need is to be able to wait for another thread to do something. Condition variables provide mutual exclusion and the ability for threads to wait for a predicate to become true.

For Java programmers, the condition variable and its working may seem eerily familiar and rightly so because the threading module borrows a lot from Java's concurrency architecture. We'll examine the similarities towards the end of the lesson. First, let's try to understand why we need condition variables in the first place.

**Why**

In the previous sections we worked with locks which are used to enforce serial access to shared state. However, locks aren't enough when threads want to coordinate among themselves. Imagine a scenario where we have two threads working together to find prime numbers and print them. Say the first thread finds the prime number and the second thread is responsible for printing the found prime. The first thread \(finder\) sets a boolean flag whenever it determines an integer is a prime number. The second \(printer\) thread needs to know when the finder thread has hit upon a prime number. The naive approach is to have the printer thread do a busy wait and keep polling for the boolean value. Let's see what this approach looks like:

**Approach 1**

```python
def printer_thread_func():
    global prime_holder
    global found_prime
 
    while not exit_prog:
        while not found_prime and not exit_prog:
            time.sleep(0.1)
 
        if not exit_prog:
            print(prime_holder)
 
            prime_holder = None
            found_prime = False
 
 
def is_prime(num):
    if num == 2 or num == 3:
        return True
 
    div = 2
 
    while div <= num / 2:
        if num % div == 0:
            return False
        div += 1
 
    return True
 
 
def finder_thread_func():
    global prime_holder
    global found_prime
 
    i = 1
 
    while not exit_prog:
 
        while not is_prime(i):
            i += 1
 
        prime_holder = i
        found_prime = True
 
        while found_prime and not exit_prog:
            time.sleep(0.1)
 
        i += 1
 
 
found_prime = False
prime_holder = None
exit_prog = False
 
printer_thread = Thread(target=printer_thread_func)
printer_thread.start()
 
finder_thread = Thread(target=finder_thread_func)
finder_thread.start()
 
# Let the threads run for 5 seconds
time.sleep(3)
 
# Let the threads exit
exit_prog = True
 
printer_thread.join()
finder_thread.join()
```

Notice we aren't using any synchronization primitives in the program above. Not even locks to guard writes to shared variables. The program goes through two states, finding primes and then printing them, and repeats the sequence. The above program would work because there are only two threads involved but would fail with greater than two threads. Folks with Java background would realize that a similar program in Java wouldn't work given the memory model of Java, and would likely require the shared variables to be marked volatile.

The above program is essentially a producer-consumer problem. The printer thread is a consumer and the finder thread is a producer. The printer thread needs to be signaled somehow that a prime number has been discovered for it to print. Do you see a condition here? The condition in our program is the discovery of the prime number represented by the boolean variable `found_prime`. Realize that locks don't help us signal other threads when a condition becomes true.

One shortcoming of the above code is we have the printer thread constantly polling in a while loop for the `found_prime` variable to become true. This is called busy waiting and is highly discouraged as it unnecessarily wastes CPU cycles. Ideally, the printer thread should go to sleep so that it doesn't consume any system resources and be woken up when the condition it needs to act upon becomes true. This can be achieved through condition variables.

We create a condition variable as follows:

**Creating a condition variable**

```text
cond_var = Condition()
```

The two important methods of a condition variable are:

* `wait()` - invoked to make a thread sleep and give up resources
* `notify()` - invoked by a thread when a condition becomes true and the invoking threads want to inform the waiting thread or threads to proceed

A condition variable is always associated with a lock. The lock can be either reentrant or a plain vanilla lock. The associated lock must be acquired before a thread can invoke `wait()`or `notify()` on the condition variable.

**Incorrect way of using condition variables**

```text
cond_var = Condition()
cond_var.wait()  # throws an error
```

We can create a lock ourselves and pass it to the condition variable's constructor. If no lock object is passed then a lock is created underneath the hood by the condition variable. In the examples below we demonstrate all the different ways of invoking condition variables.

We can create the condition variable as follows:

**Creating a condition variable by passing a custom lock**

```text
lock = Lock()
cond_var = Condition(lock) # pass custom lock to condition variable
cond_var.acquire()
cond_var.wait()
```

We can also create a condition variable without passing in a custom lock.

**Creating a condition variable without passing a lock**

```text
cond_var = Condition()
cond_var.acquire()
cond_var.wait()
```

Given what we know so far about condition variables, let's try to rewrite the printer thread code from the previous section. Note, that we are checking for the boolean variables in an `if` statement.

**Printer thread refactored code**

```text
cond_var = Condition()
found_prime = False
prime_holder = None
exit_prog = False
 
def printer_thread_func():
    global prime_holder
    global found_prime
 
    while not exit_prog:
 
        # check for predicate
        cond_var.acquire()
        if not found_prime and not exit_prog:
            cond_var.wait()
        cond_var.release()
         
 
        if not exit_prog:
            print(prime_holder)
            prime_holder = None
            
            # acquire lock before modifying shared variable
            cond_var.acquire()
            found_prime = False
            # remember to wake up the other thread
            cond_var.notify()
            cond_var.release()
 
```

Note that we have rid ourselves of the busy wait loop. Now we check if the `found_prime` is false and if so we first acquire the lock on the condition variable and then invoke the `wait()` method on it. When the finder thread invokes `notify()` on the variable `cond_var`, that is the moment when the printer thread will wake up from its slumber and continue.

There are however two questions we need to answer:

* If the printer thread acquires the lock on the condition variable `cond_var` then how can the finder thread `acquire()` the lock when it needs to invoke the `notify()` method?
* Can the condition, which is the variable `found_prime`, change once the printer thread is woken up?

The answer to the first question is that when a thread invokes `wait()` it simultaneously gives up the lock associated with the condition variable. Only when the sleeping thread wakes up again on a `nofity()`, will it reacquire the lock.

The second question is very important and leads us to the correct idiomatic usage of the condition variable. The way we have nested the acquire and wait call under an if statement is incorrect. The reason is that if a thread invokes `notifyAll()` on a condition variable, then all the threads waiting on the condition variable will be woken up but only one thread will be allowed to make progress. Once the first thread exits the critical section and releases the lock associated with the condition variable, another thread, from the set of threads that were waiting when the original `notifyAll()` call was made, is allowed to make progress. This may not be appropriate for every use case and certainly not for ours if we had multiple printer threads. We would want a printer thread to make progress only when the condition `found_prime` is set to true. This can only be possible with a while loop where we check if the condition `found_prime` is true before allowing a printer thread to move ahead. The change will look as follows:

```text
    cond_var.acquire()
    while not found_prime and not exit_prog:
        cond_var.wait()
    cond_var.release()
```

On a side note, remember that a woken up thread reacquires the lock associated with the condition variable the thread was waiting on and doesn't give up the lock until it releases the condition variable. Hence, any statements executed between the `wait()` and the `release()` call would happen while the thread holds the lock assuring mutual exclusion within that block of code. Consider the below pseudocode:

```text
0.     cond_var.acquire()
1.     while predicate is not True:
2.         cond_var.wait()
3.    
4.     # code statement 1
5.     # code statement 2
6.     # code statement 3
7.        
8.     cond_var.release()
```

In the hypothetical snippet above, the **lines 2 to 8** would be executed by a woken up thread while holding the lock associated with the condition variable.

**Spurious Wakeups**

We may convince ourselves to not use a while loop if we only have a single printer thread in our program. However, a thread can be woken up even if there has been no notification!

A peculiarity of condition variables is the possibility of spurious wakeups. It means that a thread might wakeup as if it has been signaled even though nobody called `notify()` on the condition variable in question. This is specifically allowed by the POSIX standard because it allows more efficient implementations of condition variables under some circumstances. Such wakeups are called **spurious wakeups**.

A thread that has been woken up does not imply that the conditions for it to move forward hold. The thread must test the conditions again for validity before moving forward. In conclusion, we must always check for conditions in a loop and `wait()` inside it. The correct idiomatic usage of a condition variable appears below:

**Idiomatic use of wait\(\)**

```text
acquire lock
while(condition_to_test is not satisfied):
    wait
 
# condition is now true, perform necessary tasks
 
release lock
```

The idiomatic usage to notify\(\) is as follows:

**Idiomatic use of notify**

```text
acquire lock
set condition_to_test to true/satisfied
notify
release lock
```

Let's rewrite our printer thread first using the correct condition variable pattern. The first task the printer does is to wait for a prime number to become available. We can achieve that using the following snippet:

**Printer thread waiting**

```text
        cond_var.acquire()
        while not found_prime and not exit_prog:
            cond_var.wait()
        cond_var.release()
```

Once the printer thread has printed the found prime number, it needs to let the finder thread know to continue finding the next prime number. To achieve that we'll notify the condition variable after printing the prime number. In the finder thread code, we'll make the finder thread wait on the condition variable. The complete code for the printer thread appears below:

**Printer threaddef printer\_thread\(\):    global prime\_holder    global found\_prime     while not exit\_prog:         \# wait for a prime number to become        \# available for printing        cond\_var.acquire\(\)        while not found\_prime and not exit\_prog:            cond\_var.wait\(\)        cond\_var.release\(\)         if not exit\_prog:            \# print the prime number            print\(prime\_holder\)             \# reset. We can skip this statement if we like            prime\_holder = None             \# make sure to wake up the finder thread            cond\_var.acquire\(\)            found\_prime = False            cond\_var.notify\(\)            cond\_var.release\(\)**  


**Finder Thread**

Now we'll turn our attention to the finder thread. It first attempts to find a prime number. Once found, it needs to communicate to the printer thread that a prime number is ready for printing. It does that by signaling the condition variable as follows:

**Finder thread signaling printer thread**

```text
        cond_var.acquire()
        found_prime = True
        cond_var.notify()
        cond_var.release()
```

The next step for the finder thread is to wait for the printer thread to complete its printing. The finder thread simply waits on the same condition variable for the printer thread to signal. The complete code for the finder thread appears below:

**Finder thread**

```text
def finder_thread():
    global prime_holder
    global found_prime
 
    i = 1
 
    while not exit_prog:
 
        while not is_prime(i):
            i += 1
 
        primeHolder = i
 
        cond_var.acquire()
        found_prime = True
        cond_var.notify()
        cond_var.release()
 
        cond_var.acquire()
        while found_prime and not exit_prog:
            cond_var.wait()
        cond_var.release()
 
        i += 1
 
```

**Main Thread**

Let's not forget the main thread which spawns both the printer and the finder threads. Note that the variable `exit_prog` is solely to control how long our program runs but doesn't affect the core working of the two spawned threads. The main thread needs to signal the condition variable too because it is possible that one of the threads ends up waiting on the condition variable while the other thread exits its while loop, causing the program to hang. The code for the main thread appears below:

**Finder thread**

```text
cond_var = Condition()
found_prime = False
prime_holder = None
exit_prog = False
 
printer_thread = Thread(target=printer_thread_func)
printer_thread.start()
 
finder_thread = Thread(target=finder_thread_func)
finder_thread.start()
 
# Let the threads run for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)
 
# Let the threads exit
exit_prog = True
 
cond_var.acquire()
cond_var.notifyAll()
cond_var.release()
 
printer_thread.join()
finder_thread.join()
 
```

The complete code for the program appears below:

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Condition
import time


def printer_thread_func():
    global prime_holder
    global found_prime

    while not exit_prog:

        cond_var.acquire()
        while not found_prime and not exit_prog:
            cond_var.wait()
        cond_var.release()

        if not exit_prog:
            print(prime_holder)

            prime_holder = None

            cond_var.acquire()
            found_prime = False
            cond_var.notify()
            cond_var.release()


def is_prime(num):
    if num == 2 or num == 3:
        return True

    div = 2

    while div <= num / 2:
        if num % div == 0:
            return False
        div += 1

    return True


def finder_thread_func():
    global prime_holder
    global found_prime

    i = 1

    while not exit_prog:

        while not is_prime(i):
            i += 1
            # Add a timer to slow down the thread
            # so that we can see the output
            time.sleep(.01)

        prime_holder = i

        cond_var.acquire()
        found_prime = True
        cond_var.notify()
        cond_var.release()

        cond_var.acquire()
        while found_prime and not exit_prog:
            cond_var.wait()
        cond_var.release()

        i += 1


cond_var = Condition()
found_prime = False
prime_holder = None
exit_prog = False

printerThread = Thread(target=printer_thread_func)
printerThread.start()

finderThread = Thread(target=finder_thread_func)
finderThread.start()

# Let the threads run for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)

# Let the threads exit
exit_prog = True

cond_var.acquire()
cond_var.notifyAll()
cond_var.release()

printerThread.join()
finderThread.join()

```

In the previous sections, we worked with `wait()` and `notify()` methods. These methods have closely related cousins which take in parameters. We discuss them as follows:

**wait\(n\)**

The `wait(n)` method takes in a floating point parameter n. This is the number of seconds a calling thread would wait to be notified by another thread. The wait method times out after n seconds and the thread is woken up even if no notification is received. Consider the below snippet:

**Using wait\(n\)**

```text
from threading import Condition
from threading import Thread
import time
 
flag = False
 
cond_var = Condition()
 
 
def child_task():
    cond_var.acquire()
 
    if (flag == False):
        cond_var.wait(1)
 
    if (flag == False):
        print("child thread times out waiting for a notification")
 
    # don't forget to release the lock    
    cond_var.release()
 
 
thread = Thread(target=child_task)
thread.start()
 
time.sleep(3)
thread.join()
 
```

Note that we have digressed from the idiomatic usage of the wait method by not testing for the condition in a while loop. Since we don't want the child thread to be stuck in a loop waiting for a condition to become true we are using an if statement. The child thread times out after one second.

```python
from threading import Condition
from threading import Thread
import time

flag = False

cond_var = Condition()


def child_task():
    cond_var.acquire()

    if (flag == False):
        cond_var.wait(1)

    if (flag == False):
        print("child thread times out waiting for a notification")

    # don't forget to release the lock    
    cond_var.release()


thread = Thread(target=child_task)
thread.start()

time.sleep(3)
thread.join()
```

**notify\_all \( \)**

`notify_all()` method can be used when there is more than one thread waiting on a condition variable. It can also be used if there's a single thread waiting. The sequence of events on a `notify_all()` when multiple threads are waiting is described below:

* A thread comes along acquires the lock associated with the condition variable, and calls `wait()`
* The thread invoking `wait()` gives up the lock and goes to sleep or is taken off the CPU timeslice
* The given up lock can be reacquired by a second thread that then too calls `wait()`, gives up the lock, and goes to sleep.
* Notice that the lock is available for any other thread to acquire and either invoke a wait or a notify on the associated condition variable.
* Another thread comes along acquires the lock and invokes `notify_all()` and subsequently releases the lock.
* Note it is imperative to release the lock, otherwise the waiting threads can't reacquire the lock and return from the `wait()` call.
* The waiting threads are all woken up but only one of them gets to acquire the lock. This thread returns from the `wait()` method and proceeds forward. The thread selected to acquire the lock is random and not in the order in which threads invoked `wait()`.
* Once the thread that is the first to wake up and make progress releases the lock, other threads acquire the lock one by one and proceed ahead.

Study the code snippet below, where we initially have three threads wait on a condition variable before `notify_all()` is used to wake them all.

## Semaphores

This lesson introduces semaphores and their uses in Python.

#### Semaphores

Semaphore is one of the oldest synchronization primitives, invented by [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). A semaphore is nothing more than an atomic counter that gets decremented by one whenever `acquire()` is invoked and incremented by one whenever `release()` is called. The semaphore can be initialized with an initial count value. If none is specified, the semaphore is initialized with a value of one.

**Creating semaphore**

```text
# semaphore initialized with a default count of 1
semaphore = Semaphore()
 
# semaphore initialized with count set to 5
sem_with_count = Semaphore(5)
```

**acquire \( \)**

If a thread invokes `acquire()` on a semaphore, the semaphore counter is decremented by one. If the count is greater than 0, then the thread immediately returns from the `acquire()` call. If the semaphore counter is zero when a thread invokes `acquire()`, the thread gets blocked till another thread releases the semaphore.

**release \( \)**

When a thread invokes the `release()` method, the internal semaphore counter is incremented by one. If the counter value is zero and another thread is already blocked on an `acquire()` then a release would unblock the waiting thread. If multiple threads are blocked on the semaphore, then one thread is arbitrarily chosen.

**Using Semaphores**

Semaphores can be used in versatile ways. The primary use of semaphores is signaling among threads which are working to achieve a common goal. Consider the below snippet which uses a condition variable between threads.

**Missed Signal**

```text
from threading import Thread
from threading import Condition
import time
 
 
def task1():
    cond_var.acquire()
    cond_var.wait()
    cond_var.release()
 
 
def task2():
    cond_var.acquire()
    cond_var.notify()
    cond_var.release()
 
 
cond_var = Condition()
 
# start thread 2 first which invokes notify
thread2 = Thread(target=task2)
thread2.start()
 
# delay starting thread 1 by three seconds
time.sleep(3)
 
# start thread 1
thread1 = Thread(target=task1)
thread1.start()
 
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
 
```

The above program will never exit since the notifying thread notifies before the first thread has a chance to wait on the condition variable. This is a manifestation of a **missed signal**.

You may realize from your reading in the previous sections that the way we are using the condition variable's `wait()` method is incorrect. The idiomatic usage of `wait()` is in a while loop with an associated boolean condition. For now, observe the possibility of losing signals between threads.

The faulty program appears in the code widget below:

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Condition
import time


def task1():
    cond_var.acquire()
    cond_var.wait()
    cond_var.release()


def task2():
    cond_var.acquire()
    cond_var.notify()
    cond_var.release()


cond_var = Condition()

# start thread 2 first which invokes notify
thread2 = Thread(target=task2)
thread2.start()

# delay starting thread 1 by three seconds
time.sleep(3)

# start thread 1
thread1 = Thread(target=task1)
thread1.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```

One way to remedy the above situation is to use semaphores. The internal counter of the semaphore remembers how many times the signal was received. Replacing the above code with semaphore looks as follows:

**Fixing missed signal**

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Semaphore
import time
 
 
def task1():
    sem.acquire()
 
 
def task2():
    sem.release()
 
# initialize with zero
sem = Semaphore(0)
 
# start thread 2 first which invokes release()
thread2 = Thread(target=task2)
thread2.start()
 
# delay starting thread 1 by three seconds
time.sleep(3)
 
# start thread 1
thread1 = Thread(target=task1)
thread1.start()
 
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
 
```

Note that we are initializing the semaphore with a count of zero. If we used the default initialization of 1, then the first call to `acquire()` would not block the thread.

**Rewriting the prime printer program**

As an additional example, we rewrite our prime printer program from previous sections using semaphores. Note how the code becomes less verbose and possibly easier to follow:

**Printer Program**

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Semaphore
import time
 
 
def printer_thread():
    global primeHolder
 
    while not exitProg:
        # wait for a prime number to become available
        sem_find.acquire()
 
        # print the prime number
        print(primeHolder)
        primeHolder = None
 
        # let the finder thread find the next prime
        sem_print.release()
 
 
def is_prime(num):
    if num == 2 or num == 3:
        return True
 
    div = 2
 
    while div <= num / 2:
        if num % div == 0:
            return False
        div += 1
    return True
 
 
def finder_thread():
    global primeHolder
 
    i = 1
 
    while not exitProg:
 
        while not is_prime(i):
            i += 1
            # Add a timer to slow down the thread
            # so that we can see the output
            time.sleep(.01)
 
        primeHolder = i
 
        # let the printer thread know we have
        # a prime available for printing
        sem_find.release()
 
        # wait for printer thread to complete
        # printing the prime number
        sem_print.acquire()
 
        i += 1
 
 
sem_find = Semaphore(0)
sem_print = Semaphore(0)
primeHolder = None
exitProg = False
 
printerThread = Thread(target=printer_thread)
printerThread.start()
 
finderThread = Thread(target=finder_thread)
finderThread.start()
 
# Let the threads run for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)
 
exitProg = True
 
printerThread.join()
finderThread.join()
```

## Events

This lesson talks about Events, which is a lesser known utility class within the threading module.

#### Events

An event object is one of the simplest primitives available for synchronization. Internally, it has a boolean flag that can be set or unset using the methods `set()` and `clear()`. Additionally, a thread can check if the flag is set to true by invoking the `is_set()` method.

The event object exposes a `wait()` method that threads can invoke to wait for the internal boolean flag to become true. If the flag is already true, the thread returns immediately. If there are multiple threads waiting on the event object and an active thread sets the flag then all the waiting threads are unblocked.

`Event` is a convenience class and a wrapper over a condition variable with a boolean predicate. This is the most common setup for many cooperating threads where two or more threads coordinate among themselves on a boolean predicate.

**Differences with Semaphores**

Event objects may seem similar to semaphore or a bounded semaphore but there are slight differences:

* An unbounded semaphore can have its internal counter incremented as many times as `acquire()` is invoked on it, whereas an event object maintains an internal boolean flag that can only flip between two state: set or unset.
* Can a bounded semaphore intialized to 1 be equivalent to an event object? The answer is no because the bounded semaphore will raise a `ValueError` if the bounded semaphore is acquired more number of times than the initial passed in capacity. Also acquiring a semaphore decrements the internal counter of the semaphore whereas waiting on an event object doesn't change the state of the internal boolean flag.
* A thread never gets blocked on `wait()` of an event object if the internal flag is set to true no matter how many times the thread invokes the `wait()` method.

Below is a naive example of using event to coordinate interaction between two threads:

**Event example**

```text
from threading import Thread
from threading import Event
import time
 
 
def task1():
    event.wait()
    event.wait()
    event.wait()
    print("thread invoked wait thrice")
 
 
def task2():
    time.sleep(1)
    event.set()
 
 
event = Event()
 
thread1 = Thread(target=task1)
thread1.start()
 
thread2 = Thread(target=task2)
thread2.start()
 
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```

We can implement our prime printing program using events. The code appears below:

**Prime printing program using events**

```python
from threading import Thread
from threading import Event
import time
 
 
def printer_thread():
    global primeHolder
 
    while not exitProg:
        # wait for a prime number to become available
        prime_available.wait()
 
        # print the prime number
        print(primeHolder)
        primeHolder = None
 
        # reset the event to false
        prime_available.clear()
 
        # let the finder thread know that printing is done
        prime_printed.set()
 
 
def is_prime(num):
    if num == 2 or num == 3:
        return True
 
    div = 2
 
    while div <= num / 2:
        if num % div == 0:
            return False
        div += 1
    return True
 
 
def finder_thread():
    global primeHolder
 
    i = 1
 
    while not exitProg:
 
        while not is_prime(i):
            i += 1
            # Add a timer to slow down the thread
            # so that we can see the output
            time.sleep(.01)
 
        primeHolder = i
 
        # let the printer thread know we have
        # a prime available for printing
        prime_available.set()
 
        # wait for printer thread to print the prime
        prime_printed.wait()
 
        # reset the flag
        prime_printed.clear()
 
        i += 1
 
 
 
prime_available = Event()
prime_printed = Event()
primeHolder = None
exitProg = False
 
printerThread = Thread(target=printer_thread)
printerThread.start()
 
finderThread = Thread(target=finder_thread)
finderThread.start()
 
# Let the threads run for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)
 
exitProg = True
prime_available.set()
prime_printed.set()
 
printerThread.join()
finderThread.join()
```

## Timer

This lesson discusses the Timer class with examples.

#### Timer

The Timer object allows execution of a callable object after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Consider the snippet below where a `Timer` object executes the method `say_hi()` in a different thread than the main thread. The thread names can be observed from the output.

**Creating a timer**

```python
from threading import Timer
from threading import current_thread
import time
 
 
def say_hi():
    print("{0} says Hi!".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
 
timer = Timer(1, say_hi)
timer.start()
 
time.sleep(2)
 
print("{0} exiting".format(current_thread().getName()))
```

The timer constructor takes in a floating point number representing the seconds that need to elapse before the task is executed. Though when the task is executed may not be exactly after the passed in number of seconds. It may be slightly more than the interval passed in.

Time is a subclass of the `Thread` class and similarly accepts arguments as a list or a keyword dictionary.

A timer object can also be cancelled using the `cancel()` method before the task has been executed.

## Barrier

This lesson discusses the all-important barrier synchronization construct.

#### Barrier

A barrier is a synchronization construct to wait for a certain number of threads to reach a common synchronization point in code. The involved threads each invoke the barrier object's `wait()` method and get blocked till all of threads have called `wait()`. When the last thread invokes `wait()` all of the waiting threads are released simultaneously. The below snippet shows example usage of barrier:

**Using a barrier**

```python
from threading import Barrier
from threading import Thread
import random
import time
 
 
def thread_task():
    time.sleep(random.randint(0, 7))
    print("\nCurrently {0} threads blocked on barrier".format(barrier.n_waiting))
    barrier.wait()
 
 
num_threads = 5
barrier = Barrier(num_threads)
threads = [0] * num_threads
 
for i in range(num_threads):
    threads[i - 1] = Thread(target=thread_task)
 
for i in range(num_threads):
    threads[i].start()
```

The barrier constructor also accepts a callable argument as an action to be performed when threads are released. Only one of the threads released will invoke the action. An example is given below:

```python
from threading import Barrier
from threading import Thread
from threading import current_thread
import random
import time
 
 
def thread_task():
    time.sleep(random.randint(0, 5))
    print("\nCurrently {0} threads blocked on barrier".format(barrier.n_waiting))
    barrier.wait()
 
 
def when_all_threads_released():
    print("All threads released, reported by {0}".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
 
num_threads = 5
barrier = Barrier(num_threads, action=when_all_threads_released)
threads = [0] * num_threads
 
for i in range(num_threads):
    threads[i - 1] = Thread(target=thread_task)
 
for i in range(num_threads):
    threads[i].start()
```

If you execute the above snippet multiple times, you'll see that the action passed into barrier constructor is executed by a randomly chosen thread each time.

**Broken Barriers**

The barrier object exposes an `abort()` method which can be invoked to avoid deadlocks if needed. Threads already waiting on a barrier experience a `BrokenBarrierError` if `abort()` is invoked. The example below demonstrates this scenario.

**Breaking barriers**

```text
from threading import Barrier
from threading import Thread
import time
 
 
def thread_task():
    print("\nCurrently {0} threads blocked on barrier".format(barrier.n_waiting))
    barrier.wait()
    print("Barrier broken")
 
 
num_threads = 5
barrier = Barrier(num_threads + 1)
threads = [0] * num_threads
 
for i in range(num_threads):
    threads[i - 1] = Thread(target=thread_task)
 
for i in range(num_threads):
    threads[i].start()
 
time.sleep(3)
 
print("Main thread about to invoke abort on barrier")
barrier.abort()
```

## With

This lesson introduces the use of with and context management with synchronization primitives.

#### With

Programs often use resources other than CPU time, including access to local disks, network sockets, and databases etc. The usage pattern is usually a `try-except-finally` block. Any cleanup actions are performed in the `finally` block. An alternative to the usual boilterplate code is to use the `with` statement. The `with` statement wraps the execution of a block of statements in a context defined by a **context manager** object.

**Context Management Protocol**

A context manager object abides by the context management protocol, which states that an object defines the following two methods. Python calls these two methods at appropriate times in the resource management cycle:

* `__enter__()`
* `__exit__()`

The with statement is used as:

```text
    with context-expression [as target]:
        statement#1
        statement#2
            .
            .
            .
        statement#n
```

* `__enter__()` should return an object that is assigned to the variable after **as** in the above template. By default the returned object is None, and is optional. A common pattern is to return self and keep the functionality required within the same class.
* `__exit__()` is called on the original Context Manager object, not the object returned by `__enter__()`. If, however, we return self in the `__enter__()` method, then it is obviously the same object.
* If an error is raised in `__init__()` or `__enter__()` then the code block is never executed and `__exit__()` is not called.
* Once the code block is entered, `__exit__` is always called, even if an exception is raised in the code block.
* In case an exception is raised when executing the block of code wrapped by the `with` statement, three values consisting of the exception types, its value and traceback are passed as arguments to the `__exit__()` method. These parameters are None if no exceptions occur. Lastly, if an exception was raised and the `__exit__()` method returns True, the exception is suppressed. On the contrary, if `__exit__()` returns false then the exception is re-raised.

Context managers can be used in scenarios to save and restore global state, lock and unlock resources, close opened files, etc.

**Example**

The most common use of the `with` statement happens when we manipulate files. Without the `with` statement, file manipulation would look as follows:

```text
    file = None
    try:
        file = open("test.txt")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
 
    finally:
        if file is not None:
            file.close()
```

Using the `with` statement the above code is simplified as:

```text
with open("test.txt") as file:    
    data = file.read() 
```

The `with` statement helps simplify some common resource management patterns by abstracting their functionality and allowing them to be factored out and reused. The code becomes expressive and easier to read. In fact, we can write a class that implements the enter and exit methods and makes it compatible with the `with` statement. An example is shown below:

```text
class ExampleClass(object):
 
    def __init__(self, val):
        print("init")
        self.val = val

**Using With Statement in Multithreading**

Some classes in the `threading` module such as `Lock`, support the context management protocol and can be used with the `with` statement. In the example below, we reproduce an example from an earlier section and use the `with` statement with the `Lock` object `my_lock`. Note, we don't need to explicitly `acquire()` and `release()` the lock object. The context manager automatically takes care of managing the lock for us.

```text
sharedState = [1, 2, 3]
my_lock = Lock()
 
 
def thread1_operations():
 
    with my_lock:
        print("{0} has acquired the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
        time.sleep(3)  #
        sharedState[0] = 777
 
        print("{0} about to release the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
    print("{0} released the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
 
def thread2_operations():
    print("{0} is attempting to acquire the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
    with my_lock:
        print("{0} has acquired the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
        print(sharedState[0])
        print("{0} about to release the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
    print("{0} released the lock".format(current_thread().getName()))
 
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # create and run the two threads
    thread1 = Thread(target=thread1_operations, name="thread1")
    thread1.start()
 
    thread2 = Thread(target=thread2_operations, name="thread2")
    thread2.start()
 
    # wait for the two threads to complete
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
```
