## Network Segmentation

### Why we need segmentation

In any local network like a small corporate network, there could be few things that affect network.

### Bad actor

It could compromise the network resources it has access to. Like a host in the sales department trying to access application server through local network.

### Limiting

In a single-scoped network, bandwidth competition could lead to quality of service issues for important services and hosts.

### Scaling

Needs to easily scale out.

### Benefits

* Improve network performance and speed
* Reduce network congestion
* Enhance security
* Controlled Expansion
* Maintenance and Administration
